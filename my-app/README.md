<!-- dash-content-start -->

A modern full-stack template powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for backend APIs, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for frontend routing, and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for beautiful, accessible components styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Built with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) for optimized static asset delivery and seamless local development. React is configured in single-page app (SPA) mode via Workers.

**Recent Update**: Migrated from Cloudflare KV to Cloudflare D1 for persistent data storage with SQL capabilities.

A perfect starting point for building interactive, styled, and edge-deployed SPAs with minimal configuration.

   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Create and setup D1 database**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-d1.sh
   ```

4. **Apply database migrations**:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 migrations apply my-app-db
   ```

5. **Deploy your application**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
